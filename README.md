# Which Theme/Font is That?

![Grandma finds the Internet](https://github.com/sjardim/whichthemeisthat/blob/master/grandma.jpg?raw=true)

Tired of hearing that question when you share a screenshot or a tutorial on YouTube? Your problems are over! :)

Introducing "Which Theme is That" Visual Studio Code extension. 

This extension will show on the status bar your workspace's current theme name and font. 

## Install

Grab it here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sjardim.whichthemeisthat

## How to Run

Install the extension and run the Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> on Mac. Search for "**Which Theme is That?**" and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 

The extension will run **only on the currently opened window** and will **deactivate** once it's closed. This was intentional as the idea was just to use it when recording a tutorial or taking screenshots as the theme and font names may take too much space on your status bar, and hide more useful information during development.

> Tip: If you change the theme and/or font during a tutorial, the extension will automatically update it on the status bar.


**Enjoy!**
